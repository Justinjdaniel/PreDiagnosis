As per guidelines, node-modules  are avoided while compressing, for a better user experience use smooth scrolling (optional) { In chrome: enabling a simple flag will do the trick  **chrome://flags/#smooth-scrolling**  }

**Known Bugs:**
 1. Multiple selection in image (disabled attribute was not worked in image mapping tag, due to that multiple image area can be selected instead of one at a time , even though the values of last selection only will be recorded.)
 2. Sometime the the suggested website won't display in iframe (error: Google won't respond) , but doctor page works perfectly in that same tag.
 3. Check button hides the result section on second click _not fn is used here_ :(
